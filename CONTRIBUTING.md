# Plop Grizzly Contributing Guidelines v1.0.0

Want to contribute to the Aldaron's Format Interface (afi)?
Here's how to get started!

## Bug Reports
If you want to report a bug, open an issue and provide:
* Target platform
* Description of what went wrong
* Code sample (if applicable)
* Screenshot (if applicable)

## Feature Request
If you want to request a feature, all you have to do is open an issue with a
description of the feature.

## Support Request
If you want a platform and/or backend to be supported that currently isn't, you can open an issue.

## Bug Fixes
If you have fixed a bug in one of the bug reports, make a pull request for it to be reviewed.
Please keep consistent to the code style of the project.
You can find the rules on how Plop Grizzly formats code [here](http://plopgrizzly.com/dev_guidelines).

## Adding Features
If you have added a feature from one of the feature requests, make a pull request for it to be reviewed.

## Adding Backend/Platform Support
If you've added platform or backend support, make a pull request for it to be reviewed.
Unlike features, you are not required to open an issue before making a pull request.

## Questions
If you have any questions about the contributing process, or would like to communicate about it, contact me at jeron.lau@plopgrizzly.com.
All help in developing Plop Grizzly's projects is greatly appreciated.
All developers who have contributed will have their name and email added to the Cargo.toml "authors" section.
